Earthquake visualizations by applying Kmeans clustering

Using entirely open source packages to cluster/visualize earthquakes
around the globe.

Work in progress as it was my personal Saturday night hackathon to
do something with  a few packages I had written:

* [USGS](https://github.com/odeke-em/usgs)
* [kmeans](https://github.com/odeke-em/kmeans)
* [mapbox](https://github.com/odeke-em/mapbox) -- currently excluded but will
be used when I spend more time to flesh something more out.

Then use the OSS work by the folks at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
with their JS libraries.
